# Data-Collection-Challenge
Module 11, Data-Collection Challenge
This module took on the challenge of web-scraping along with data analysis and included two deliverables. 
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

I utilized the skills I have learned throughout this bootcamp along with help from my tutor, Anna Poulakos, asking questions with the Xpert on the BootCamp Canvas and referencing some of Alexander's Jupyter Notebook to double check my work.
